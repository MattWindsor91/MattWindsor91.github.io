        <p>It&rsquo;s a new year, and the night before I go back down the mines of
<a href="https://github.com/MattWindsor91/act">automated compiler testing</a>.  It&rsquo;s also
a while since I&rsquo;ve posted here, so I thought I&rsquo;d fix that.  But what
to talk about?</p>
<p>It crossed my mind that I have a lot of computer-<em>ish</em> things I
want to do this year that aren&rsquo;t directly related to my research remit.  I
figured it might be interesting to discuss them for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives me something to look back on in 2021 to see how many
diverse things I managed to do in the year;</li>
<li>It lets me elaborate on some of the thoughts and justifications swimming
in my head;</li>
<li>If any of them seem daft, or have already been done, etc., someone might stop me! :)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-more-practical-_starling_-tool">A more practical <em>Starling</em> tool</h1>
<p>My PhD focused on <em>Starling</em>, an approach for building concurrency verification
tools on top of sequential ones.  A large amount of the PhD focused on building
<a href="https://github.com/MattWindsor91/starling-tool">one such tool</a> in F#.  This
tool was mainly a proof of concept, and has a few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The language is a strange mashup of C, pseudocode, and high-level
concepts.  I found during the PhD that the focus of the language moved from
being &lsquo;close to the metal&rsquo; and nominally intended for concurrency
implementers to being more abstract and intended for sketching and proving at
the algorithm level.  A more useful language would be closer to pseudocode.</li>
<li>The tool&rsquo;s implementation didn&rsquo;t scale well as more and more concepts, and
more and more backends, were added to it.  A re-thinking of the tool might
make it easier both to handle the existing burden and to expand it later on.</li>
<li>Specific issues with the present tool include the way in which parsing and
desugaring interoperate, as well as the tool&rsquo;s poor error reporting (caused by
not enough information being propagated or inferred throughout the process).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why would a new tool be useful, given that the likelihood of actual adoption is
unlikely?  Aside from my own personal amusement, as well as possibly being a
springboard for further <em>Starling</em> research, one thought that came to me is the
possible use of such a tool as an educational aid (for teaching the joys of
concurrent proof, perhaps!).  This would require it to be
both robust and forgiving, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve toyed with the idea of making a new tool in C# with a language based on
Pascal (name ideas including &lsquo;Pascal with Views and Concurrency&rsquo;, or PVC for
short!), but not made much progress &ndash; this would be a huge undertaking for
little immediate gain, to be sure.</p>
<h1 id="a-relational-local-_views-framework_">A relational local <em>Views Framework</em></h1>
<p>The
<a href="https://gitlab.com/MattWindsor91/starling-coq">theory side of <em>Starling</em></a>
makes much use of the
<a href="http://microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/views.pdf"><em>Views</em> framework</a>,
both directly and in altered form (to add support for local variables).  While
these forms suffice for <em>Starling</em>, the way in which I added local variables on
top of <em>Views</em> was inelegant, and the limitation of views to single-state
facts (rather than abstracting over possible transition relations) came up in my
viva.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about, and made a little bit of progress towards in
Coq (watch this space!), is experimenting with a form of <em>Views</em> in which views
reify into relations over both local and shared states.  At this stage, I&rsquo;m
unsure as to whether this is possible (though I know that support of local
states by encoding into functions from such state to view <em>is</em>, as are
concurrency reasoning systems over relations).</p>
<p>At this stage, this is merely an excuse for me to use Coq in my downtime (I&rsquo;m
one of those people who enjoys using a theorem prover to unwind :D): it
might not actually lead anywhere; and, given the direction of concurrency proof,
the impact will likely be low.  But I want to keep exercising my concurrency
reasoning muscles over the immediate future, and this seems like a relatively
gentle way in which to do so.</p>
<h1 id="_travesty_-but-for-applicative-functors"><em>Travesty</em>, but for applicative functors</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MattWindsor91/travesty"><em>Travesty</em></a> is an OCaml library for
defining schemes of monadic traversal, bifunctors, bi-traversals, and other
&lsquo;map over data structures in complicated ways&rsquo; happenings.  It spun out of
<em>ACT</em>, the automated compiler testing environment on which I work.</p>
<p>At present, <em>Travesty</em> only supports generation of traversals and bi-traversals
over monads.  This is because monads, at the time, seemed like they were easier
to understand in OCaml, and the vast majority of use cases for <em>Travesty</em> are
indeed on monads (almost entirely the <code>Or_error</code> monad!).  However, I&rsquo;m aware of
at least one person on the OCaml forums who has expressed interest in <em>some</em>
library for generating traversals over applicative functors.</p>
<p>Re-purposing <em>Travesty</em> to accept applicatives will be a fairly nasty breaking
change, as all of the dependent code&rsquo;s instantiations of <em>Travesty</em>&lsquo;s functors
will need to re-target over applicatives.  However, it feels like this should
be done sooner rather than later, in the rare event that said dependencies grow
to become more than just <em>ACT</em>.</p>
<p>I have a few other features I&rsquo;d like to add to <em>Travesty</em> eventually, such as
PPX support for auto-deriving traversals in certain cases&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve never been
able to justify doing them in work time, and free time has gone to other things.</p>
<p>As well as <em>Travesty</em>, I&rsquo;ve been contemplating splitting other bits of ACT off
into separate libraries.  For instance, there is a fairly self-contained
subsystem of ACT that deals with command plumbing: building Unix-like &lsquo;filter&rsquo;
programs; remote invocation over <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code>; and other miscellanea.  I&rsquo;ve
been wanting to peel it off for a while, but haven&rsquo;t quite worked out the
right niche for it.</p>
<h1 id="modernised-radio-playout-system">Modernised radio playout system</h1>
<p>Finally, the thing that&rsquo;s been taking up most of my free time is an unofficial
<a href="https://github.com/MattWindsor91/BAPS2">&lsquo;modernisation&rsquo;</a> of <em>BAPS</em>, the playout
system used by my alma mater&rsquo;s <a href="https://ury.org.uk">university radio station</a>.
The original <em>BAPS2</em> was written in C++/CLI, is tied to the .NET Framework and
Windows Forms, and could be easier to maintain if modernised and restructured
somewhat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a fair bit of progress in porting bits of BAPS2 to C# on .NET Core,
recreating the presenter frontend in WPF, and trying to make a more easily
debuggable server, but there is a <em>lot</em> of work to do, both to achieve feature
parity and to make sure the result is actually maintainable.  Some of the code
I&rsquo;ve produced so far is in need of hammering down for simplicity and
scrutability - something that I really need to practice more often!</p>
<h1 id="other-things-i-want-to-do">Other things I want to do</h1>
<p>These read like a list of new years&rsquo; resolutions, but I&rsquo;m not committing to them
in such terms, so&hellip; we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the gym (I&rsquo;ve had a membership since around April, but started flagging on
attendance towards the end of the year);</li>
<li>Resume learning to drive (thwarted somewhat by semi-moving to London);</li>
<li>Become active again in the labour movement (I go through spurts of enthusiasm
followed by apathy, but now is likely to be the best time to re-enthuse
myself);</li>
<li>Contribute to at least one free/open-source project that isn&rsquo;t one of my own;</li>
<li>Try to rekindle my interests in music making and game making.</li>
</ul>
