        <p>If you&rsquo;d asked me as a teen if I ever thought I&rsquo;d take part in industrial
action, I&rsquo;d say no.  Not because I don&rsquo;t agree with the use of strikes as
leverage in disputes &mdash; I consider myself a socialist and trade unionist more
than I consider myself an academic &mdash;, but because I just never would&rsquo;ve
expected I&rsquo;d need to.</p>
<p>The UCU, my trade union, has a <a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/why-we-are-taking-action">handy little page</a>
covering why we&rsquo;re on strike.  There&rsquo;s a little asterisk here: my employer
doesn&rsquo;t engage in UCEA national pay bargaining; so, while we are striking over
a pay dispute, that dispute is specifically with Imperial College.  Imperial
UCU made a succinct <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialUCU/status/1230435033296621570">leaflet</a>
explaining the key points of both disputes.</p>
<p>What does this mean for me as a postdoc?  Well, I don&rsquo;t have any teaching hours,
so nothing has changed there.  There isn&rsquo;t a large amount of &lsquo;extra-curricular
activities&rsquo;, engagement, or anything in my schedule, so I haven&rsquo;t dropped
anything in that department.  At this stage, all I do is my research, and
working towards a paper (hopefully in mid-April).</p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m an early-career researcher, I feel this dispute affects me
greatly &mdash; not necessarily right now, where any pay changes will likely not
matter once my contract is up in 2021 &mdash; but later down the road.  There is a
pretty large chance I&rsquo;ll remain in academia until retirement, and any long-term
whittling down of the USS pension scheme will slowly but surely impact that
retirement.  Failure to deal with the pay issues of now will keep the outlook
for pay in the future bleak.  I feel solidarity for
fellow academics, researchers, and admin staff who have had pay held down since the Great
Recession and stand to keep losing money in real terms year upon year.</p>
<p>With this (and all its implications for publications, career prospects, etc.)
in mind, I&rsquo;ll be engaging with the UCU action as much as I can, while making
sure I use my time away from work productively (or, at least,
semi-productively).  I&rsquo;ve printed a few papers that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read,
but never got around to reading at work.  I&rsquo;m still hacking on some of my
various free/open-source tools, in the hope that they can be useful to others.
The &lsquo;What Every Postdoc Needs To Know&rsquo; book has migrated from my office desk to
one at home, ready for some serious leafing.</p>
<p>See you on the lines.</p>
